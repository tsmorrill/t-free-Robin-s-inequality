# t-free Robin's inequality

In 1984, Robin showed that the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to proving a particular upper bound on the sum of divisors function. This code calculates a lower bound in terms of the primorial numbers, above which Robin's inequality holds for t-free integers, that is, integers not divisible by the t-th power of any prime number.
